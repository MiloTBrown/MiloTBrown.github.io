# About

Milo Brown is pursuing a B.S. in Physics at UCSB. Their research interests include quantum gravity sensing, hyperspectral remote sensing, and climate change-type drought stress, reflecting their approach to their undergraduate experience: they supplement their physics education with courses in ecology and electrical engineering. During undergraduate summers, they worked as a WAVE Fellow at Caltech to compare optical emissions of supermassive black holes with different X-ray brightness levels using Jupyter Notebooks. They also participated in the NCAS Aerospace Scholar program, where they worked with a team of 10 to design a virtual mission to Mars. When not in class, they can be found in Dr. Blumenthal's OCPI lab and Dr. Anderegg's LEAF lab, researching photonics and plant physiology.
