I worked with a team of 10 to design a mission to Mars. We worked with mentor Raphael Grau, deputy manager of business relations on the international space station. At the end of the intensive program, we presented our plan to a group of NASA engineers. Raphael Grau nominated me as the most valuable player on the team.
