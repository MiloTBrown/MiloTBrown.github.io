My painting of the Eagle Nebula was published in the Spring 2023 issue of interdisciplinary Journal, "Caustic Frolic." The piece represents how strange, distant artifacts can feel warm and inviting, redefining what it means to be distant. The online publication of this piece can be found on the <a href="https://causticfrolic.org/art/first-flight/">Caustic Frolic website</a>.
