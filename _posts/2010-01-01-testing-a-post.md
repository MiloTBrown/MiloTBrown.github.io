## Abstract

Although origami began as a ceremonial Japanese art form, this ancient art of folding has widespread modern applications in fields ranging from biomedical engineering to the space industry. These powerful uses drive research in mathematical methods, such as conformal mapping, to design origami structures. Conformal mapping transforms the complex plane, simplifying complicated shapes while preserving the angles between any two curves. In the context of origami, the conformal mapping method inverts the output of a conformal map to design origami crease patterns. The conformal mapping technique can efficiently design foldable conical structures by inverting the complex logarithm.
